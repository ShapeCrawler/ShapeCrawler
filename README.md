## Quick Start
> `install-package ShapeCrawler`

```c#
// open existing presentation
var pres = new Presentation("some.pptx");

var shapes = pres.Slides[0].Shapes;

// get number of shapes on slide
var shapesCount = shapes.Count;

// get text
var shape = shapes.GetByName("TextBox 1");
var text = shape.TextFrame!.Text;
```

## How To?

### Create presentation

```c#
// create a new presentation
var pres = new Presentation();

var shapes = pres.Slides[0].Shapes;

// add new shape
shapes.AddRectangle(x: 50, y: 60, width: 100, height: 70);
var addedShape = shapes.Last();

addedShape.TextFrame!.Text = "Hello World!";

pres.SaveAs("my_pres.pptx");
```
